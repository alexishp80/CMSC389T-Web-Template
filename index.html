                <p>I am a senior computer science major at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
                    My academic interests include programming languages, artificial intelligence, philosophy, and 
                    linguistics. In addition to this, I am also a part of the Advanced Cybersecurity 
                    Experience for Students program in the Honors College.</p> 
                <p> Outside of class, I enjoy interacting with art. As part of both
                    the Mighty Sound of Maryland and the Maryland Pep Band, I can usually 
                    be found in the stands playing some tunes. When I'm not involved with music,
                    I enjoy learning about photography and taking some of my own photos.</p>

                <h2>Masterming: Meddling With Macros</h2>
                <p> This project features the implementation of basic syntax macros in Loot, a Racket-like language that had been developed over the semester. 
                    I used a simple replacement to modify the AST during parsing, replacing invocations of the macro with the defined behavior using the variables provided.
                    This implementation supported macros that called themselves or other macros in their body as well as macro overloading of functions.

                <h2>ACES Honeypot Project</h2>
                <p> Conducted research on the behavior of hackers that have been lured to systems of varying resources as part of a team.
                    We created several Bash scripts to facilitate the creation, monitoring, and recycling of the honeypots as well as data collection. 
                    Following deployment, we analyzed the duration of attacks and the number of commands executed for 192 attacks on our honeypot. 
                    We completed technical logs and standups over the course of 12 weeks

                <h2>MITRE ATT&CK Workbench</h2>
                <p>As part of my internship, I worked on MITRE's ATT&CK Workbench, a tool which allows users to host a local version of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, 
                    giving them the ability to modify the framework to fit their organization's needs. While on the team, I was able to streamlin the Docker installation by publishing pre-built images to the Github Container Registry, automating the process using Github Actions.
                    I was also able to implement a persistent database using MongoDB.
